# cryptoys

Cryptoys is a cryptographic library that contains cryptographic toys, like historical algorithms(rot13, playfair)
or hashing functions like md5(not yet).
<br>
<br>
The primary goal of this crate is not to make a fully functioning, save and secure cryptography library (others have done this already),
but to provide fun toys to play around with.
<br>
So please don't use this library as your primary source of encryption.


## Features:
- historical ciphers
    - playfair
    - rot13
    - caesar
    - affine
    - atbash
- key encryption
    - otp
